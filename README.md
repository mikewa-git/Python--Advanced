Application Idea

LODbrary is a library where users can upload their models to as well as import one's previously uploaded. The idea behind this tool is to provide an easy way to store and re-use models for purposes such as kitbashing or lookdev. I would like to develop this tool to allow for organization as well such as being able to create folders or groups so we can better organize our own library and make it easier to find what we're looking for. I think this tool will help artist save time when looking for old assets they've created in other project folders and over time, providing a way for artists to store different LOD's for each asset.

- Other features I would like to implement over time include:
- Being able to choose the level of detail of the asset you are uploading/importing(feature to allow uploading different LOD's under each asset)
- Adding tags so we can implement a search bar to look for assets based on keywords
- A way to check the assets we upload for problematic geometry
- Using Maya's camera to automatically generate a thumbnail for the selected asset
